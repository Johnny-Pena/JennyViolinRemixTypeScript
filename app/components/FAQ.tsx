          Why should I pay for lessons when there are many FREE resources online?
        </div>

          <p>
            I am excited that there are so many FREE resources for students to
            begin learning violin. However, having face-to-face instruction with
            a teacher guarantees that you will receive an experience tailored to
            your needs.

          Are certain people "gifted" at music making and should “non-gifted” students spend money on lessons?

            All students can create beautiful music. Each musical journey is
            unique, reflecting the individuality of every student. I believe
            everyone should enjoy the process of making music—there’s no
            competition in art. Regardless of where you are on your journey, the
            benefits to your mental health are unmatched. I'm here to support
            you every step of the way!
